        This role is simple in its duties but is made difficult by how busy the location can get. However, there is some variation to the role as a team member I was expected to cover some bar back roles instead of floor or front of house. Main duties included.
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Keeping the bar stocked with glasses </li>
        <li>Keeping the bar floor clean and safe by cleaning spillages and breakages </li>
        <li>Making prior preparations for opening</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        This role was incredibly specialised with little variation from day-to-day the role mainly encapsulated making sales, maintaining the assigned area and assisting colleagues, should it be needed. Most of the role was spent maintaining the fishing area as well as ensuring point of sale standards were met. Main roles were;
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Maintaining the Assigned section of the shop.</li>
        <li>Making sales and assisting customers</li>
        <li>Ensuring relevant standards were met and preparing for evaluations.</li>
        </ul>
